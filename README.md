# Utilizing-Graph-Algorithms-for-Early-Detection-and-Warning-of-Fraudulent-Financial-Transactions
Mobile money services are rapidly gaining traction globally, enabling financial transactions via mobile phones. This trend is particularly pronounced in developing countries, offering a workaround to their often weak institutional infrastructures (Aron, 2018). Nonetheless, the convenience of mobile money services brings with it increased vulnerabilities. Fraudulent activities for profit, facilitated by bypassing security protocols, are on the rise (Lopez-Rojas, Axelsson, and Elmir, 2016). Addressing these concerns calls for innovative fraud detection techniques.

This project delves deep into the domain of fraud detection, structured around the Big Data Analytics Lifecycle. Our team meticulously analyzed the provided dataset from varied angles, leading to the development of a robust fraud detection system tailored for financial service providers.
