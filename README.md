# Utilizing-Graph-Algorithms-for-Early-Detection-and-Warning-of-Fraudulent-Financial-Transactions
**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

Mobile money services are rapidly gaining traction globally, enabling financial transactions via mobile phones. This trend is particularly pronounced in developing countries, offering a workaround to their often weak institutional infrastructures. Nonetheless, the convenience of mobile money services brings with it increased vulnerabilities. Fraudulent activities for profit, facilitated by bypassing security protocols, are rising. Addressing these concerns calls for innovative fraud detection techniques.

This project delves deep into the fraud detection domain, structured around the Big Data Analytics Lifecycle. I led this project and our team meticulously analyzed the provided dataset from various angles, developing a robust fraud detection system tailored for financial service providers.

**ROLE**

I led a six-member team in this Project.
